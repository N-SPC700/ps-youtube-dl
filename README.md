Powershell Script for Youtube-DL

This also aims to alleviate the issue surrounding the inability to simply double click the program open.

# Disclaimer #
This script only interfaces with the tool known as "youtube-dl". As such, the script is unable to actually cause copyright infringement on it's own, and relies on an existing file than can do that. Which is sad, since I'd like to give the RIAA my two cents on their negative IQ.

# Usage #
Download the .ps1 file provided, and save to a directory/folder of your choosing. Simply run it and enter the URL. Additionally, do `set-alias -name "youtubedl" C:\Path\To\The\Script.ps1` in Powershell for extra convenience, so you can call the script anytime.


# Possible updates: #
- .bat Command Line versions may come soon.
